# Meta-Evaluation of Automatic Evaluation Metrics for Sentence Simplification

This is the accompanying repository for the paper "The (Un)Suitability of Automatic Evaluation Metrics for Sentence Simplification" (under review).

The Simplicity-DA dataset is available in the `simplicity_DA.csv` file. The folder `ratings_per_annotator` contains the individual ratings for the Simplicity-DA dataset and the Structural Simplicity dataset. We are not able to release the data from the Simplicity Gain dataset per request of their authors (please contact them if you need it).

Scripts to reproduce the analysis will be added to the `notebooks` folder.
