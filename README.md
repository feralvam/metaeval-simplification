# Meta-Evaluation of Automatic Evaluation Metrics for Sentence Simplification

This is the accompanying repository for the paper "The (Un)Suitability of Automatic Evaluation Metrics for Sentence Simplification" (under review).

The Simplicity-DA dataset is available in the `simplicity_DA.csv` file. If you require the raw human scores, without normalisation and with (anonymised) Worker_IDs, please send an email to f.alva@sheffield.ac.uk

Scripts to reproduce the analysis will be added soon.
